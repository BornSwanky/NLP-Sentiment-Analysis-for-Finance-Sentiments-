Welcome to the Financial Sentiment Analysis on X project! This tool is designed to help users analyze financial sentiment from textual data obtained from X (formerly Twitter). Whether you are mining data or using an API, this project provides an intuitive way to classify and visualize the sentiment of your text data.


## Features

Sentiment Classification: The application categorizes text into three sentiment classes:

Bullish: Indicates positive sentiment towards financial assets.
Bearish: Indicates negative sentiment towards financial assets.
Neutral: Indicates a neutral stance with no strong sentiment.
User-Friendly GUI: The graphical user interface displays the classification results in a clear and organized table format, allowing for easy interpretation of the data.

Interactive Sentiment Check: Paste any sentence into the GUI to instantly check its sentiment classification. This feature allows users to analyze specific phrases or statements quickly.
